A genetic model with dormancy
=============================

If you are after watching this [simulation](https://chainserver.pythonanywhere.com/hiv-dormancy), you may wonder about the strange variations in activity level of the viral motions: the purple ones are actively moving in the 3 dimensional space whereas the green ones stay still! What's more interesting is that a purple virus may turn into a green one and vice versa. The purple ones can also give birth to newborns until the geographic space becomes saturated in terms of viral capacity.
